# fightergameFramework, open sourced, based on worhas' liquid framework
## Theory

This framework was originally inteded to be for a fighter style ROBLOX game, but ended up never coming into fruition due to limitations in building and funding. Therefore i'm open sourcing this framework and making it more user-friendly.
This framework is based off of games such as SUPER SMASH BROS, by Nintendo, as well as Brawlhalla.

The framework uses worhas's Liquid Framework *Many useful methods and functions for player movement handling, data handling, velocity handling, ray handling and so on. (OPEN SOURCED SOON)*
